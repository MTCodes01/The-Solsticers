## **Overview**

**Celestia** was developed with the goal of **Visualising the exoplanets**. Itâ€™s designed to **View exoplanets** like viewing through the telescope based on different diameters and a 3D game-like control where the user can move freely around the space.

This repository includes the full source code for the project, covering everything from the UI to react functionality and even a python file for setting up the json file based on the required data from the dataset provided by NASA.

## **Key Features**

Here are the core features that set **Celestia** apart:

- **Data Loading:** Our system efficiently loads the data when the page is loaded and the data is available for each exoplanet, ensuring quick response times and seamless performance.
  
- **Clean User Interface:** Designed with ease of use in mind, our UI delivers a smooth user experience for PC/laptop screen sizes.
  
- **[Telescope View]:** The **Telescope View** is made to kinda resemble what the HWO telescope can see.
  
- **[3D View]:** **3D View** is made to let users explore the 3D space provided freely using the 3D Game-like Controls.
